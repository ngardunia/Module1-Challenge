# Challenge-1 

## Description 

This repository contains the rewritten code for the Horiseon website. By using the "alt" attribute, the site is now accessible for people with disabilities.
The initial code has also been modified to use the more modern smeantic HTML elements, therefore looking a lot cleaner to go over.
